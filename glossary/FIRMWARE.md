**Firmware**, sometimes called _embedded sofware_ is software that is written to the non-volatile program memory (ROM, often flash memory) of an embedded device. Firmware is _semi-permanent_, remaining in place unless replaced by updated firmware. Firmware is, in essence, software that sticks around in the hardware itself.

Some embedded systems have firmware that is only programmed once. Take, for example, a microwave that has its microcontroller programmed with necessary firmware in the factoryâ€”it is never updated.

Consumer electronic devices are increasingly capable of firmware updates. It is possible for consumers to update the firmware on many digital cameras, for instance. The process of writing or replacing (re-writing) firmware is known as _flashing_.

Common consumer devices that rely on firmware include WiFi routers, personal computers (BIOS is firmware, e.g.), home appliances, automotive systems and media players.
