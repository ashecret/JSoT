_RoHS_, or, the _Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive_, was adopted in the EU in 2003. It restricts the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of electronics, and also restricts the methods by which electronics containing hazardous materials may be disposed of (if you've ever seen the crossed-out trash-can icon on a piece of electronic equipment, this is why).

Restricted materials include especially lead (RoHS-compliant solder must be lead-free, for example), but also mercury, cadmium and others. 

As of mid-2006, electronics sold in the EU must be compliant. Though the restrictions are only enforced in the EU, many electronics and component suppliers worldwide sell a wide array of RoHS-compliant products.
