**Alternating current (AC)** is voltage or current that changes polarity or direction, respectively, at a set frequency. It is the kind of electricity that is avaiable in homes and offices.

In domestic AC power, this reversal happens typically 50 or 60 times per seconds (50Hz or 60Hz). The United States, much of Central and South America, the Caribbean and some countries scattered around the world use AC power at 60Hz; most of Europe, China, Russia, India, most of Africa and others use 50Hz.

Most consumer electronic circuits use _direct current_ (DC) power, the kind of power delivered from batteries.

Why use AC? Alternating current is useful for its efficiency in long-distance transmission of electricity, especially in its ability to use _transformers_ to convert voltages and currents. Also, AC _alternators_ are similar to DC _generators_, but are a simpler design and construction.
