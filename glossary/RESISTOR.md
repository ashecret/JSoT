A **resistor** is a passive two-terminal component that reduces current flow and lowers voltage levels in circuits. Common commercial resistors are manufactured over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude. Most typical axial resistors (pictured below) use a pattern of colored stripes to indicate resistance.

Calculating the resistance needed in a circuit can be done with [Ohm's Law](./OHMS-LAW.md).
