Summarized term definitions on [README.me](README.md) should not exceed 12-25 words or so. For longer definitions or explanations, link to an .md file in `glossary`. If a definition is simple, you do not need to add a `glossary` file.

Acronym forms of terms are best anchor-linked to fully-spelled-out forms, e.g.:

```
* **ADC**:
    see _[analog-to-digital conversion](#analog-to-digital-conversion)_
* **Analog-to-Digital Conversion**<a id="analog-to-digital-conversion"></a>:
    the conversion of analog voltages to digital values
* **Analog-to-digital converter**:
    a device that can perform _[analog-to-digital conversion](#analog-to-digital-conversion)_
```
